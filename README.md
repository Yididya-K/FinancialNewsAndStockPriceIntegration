# Financial News Sentiment Analysis and Stock Price Correlation

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the correlation between financial news sentiment and stock price movements. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we perform sentiment analysis on news headlines and establish statistical correlations with stock price changes. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights and strategies that Nova Financial Solutions can use to enhance predictive analytics capabilities.

Data Understanding
This project uses the Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID), which includes:

headline: The title of the news article.
url: Link to the full article.
publisher: The entity that published the article.
date: Publication date and time (UTC-4 timezone).
stock: Stock ticker symbol associated with the article.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involves:

Descriptive statistics of headlines, publication dates, and publishers.
Text analysis to extract sentiment and topics.
Time series analysis to examine trends in publication frequency and timing.
Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling
Sentiment Analysis: We use NLP techniques to categorize the sentiment of news headlines into positive, negative, or neutral.
Topic Modeling: LDA and other techniques are employed to discover common topics or themes in the headlines.
Time Series Analysis
We examine the frequency of publications over time and how they correlate with market events.
This includes analyzing the specific times of day when most news is released.
Correlation Analysis
We merge the sentiment scores with stock price data to explore correlations.
Statistical tests are conducted to validate the significance of these correlations.
Reporting and Insights
Investment Strategies: Based on the analysis, we propose strategies that utilize news sentiment as a predictive tool for stock market trends.
Final Report: A comprehensive report is prepared with findings, visualizations, and actionable insights.
